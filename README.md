# Portfolio_MockUp
This is my first project for Udacity,  I used media query's to make the site responsive while being resized! Any tips or pointers for my code is appreciated!


# Setup

The `container` holds all elements of the page. The sections each have specific classes for styling with CSS.

# styling

All elements are styled, please be sure to make appropriate changes when adding a new `div`, be sure to change or adjust box order for the `flex` css style!
